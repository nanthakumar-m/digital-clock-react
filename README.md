# ⏰ Digital Clock – React

The Digital Clock is a real-time React application that continuously displays the current system time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Built using setInterval() and React state, it provides a live, updating clock with a clean and minimalist interface.

This project was developed to practice working with React state, side effects using useEffect, and timing functions like setInterval() in a React.
